Using: follow the excellent tutorial on yolov5 git https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data

Note: yolov5 is fast and high accurate. Wrong detection is acceptable because fire detection is still a hard problem to solve.
      This is just a 4fun project (but the data is labeled very well with about 20000 images include gray images).
